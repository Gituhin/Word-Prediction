"In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, eating healthy food remains an important part of maintaining your health."
"While there are no specific foods that can help protect you from the virus, a nutritious diet can boost your immune system or help you fight off symptoms."
"You may not be able to share meals with friends and loved ones, but there are lots of other ways to eat well and support your health at this difficult time."
"Eating a healthy diet is not about strict limitations, staying unrealistically thin, or depriving yourself of the foods you love. Rather, it’s about feeling great, having more energy, improving your health, and boosting your mood."
"Healthy eating doesn’t have to be overly complicated. If you feel overwhelmed by all the conflicting nutrition and diet advice out there, you’re not alone."
"we all need a balance of protein, fat, carbohydrates, fiber, vitamins, and minerals in our diets to sustain a healthy body. "
Protein gives you the energy to get up and go—and keep going—while also supporting mood and cognitive function.
"Too much protein can be harmful to people with kidney disease, but the latest research suggests that many of us need more high-quality protein, especially as we age."
"While bad fats can wreck your diet and increase your risk of certain diseases, good fats protect your brain and heart"
"In fact, healthy fats—such as omega-3s—are vital to your physical and emotional health."
"Including more healthy fat in your diet can help improve your mood, boost your well-being, and even trim your waistline."
"Eating foods high in dietary fiber (grains, fruit, vegetables, nuts, and beans) can help you stay regular and lower your risk for heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. It can also improve your skin and even help you to lose weight."
"As well as leading to osteoporosis, not getting enough calcium in your diet can also contribute to anxiety, depression, and sleep difficulties."
"Whatever your age or gender, it’s vital to include calcium-rich foods in your diet, limit those that deplete calcium, and get enough magnesium and vitamins D and K to help calcium do its job."
"Carbohydrates are one of your body’s main sources of energy. But most should come from complex, unrefined carbs (vegetables, whole grains, fruit) rather than sugars and refined carbs."
"Cutting back on white bread, pastries, starches, and sugar can prevent rapid spikes in blood sugar, fluctuations in mood and energy, and a build-up of fat, especially around your waistline."
Switching to a healthy diet doesn’t have to be an all or nothing proposition.
"You don’t have to be perfect, you don’t have to completely eliminate foods you enjoy, and you don’t have to change everything all at once—that usually only leads to cheating or giving up on your new eating plan."
"Think of planning a healthy diet as a number of small, manageable steps—like adding a salad to your diet once a day."
"As your small changes become habit, you can continue to add more healthy choices."
 Cooking more meals at home can help you take charge of what you’re eating and better monitor exactly what goes into your food.
"You’ll eat fewer calories and avoid the chemical additives, added sugar, and unhealthy fats of packaged and takeout foods that can leave you feeling tired, bloated, and irritable, and exacerbate symptoms of depression, stress, and anxiety."
"When cutting back on unhealthy foods in your diet, it’s important to replace them with healthy alternatives."
Replacing dangerous trans fats with healthy fats (such as switching fried chicken for grilled salmon) will make a positive difference to your health.
"It’s important to be aware of what’s in your food as manufacturers often hide large amounts of sugar or unhealthy fats in packaged food, even food claiming to be healthy."
"The healthier the food you eat, the better you’ll feel after a meal."
"The more junk food you eat, the more likely you are to feel uncomfortable, nauseous, or drained of energy."
"Drink plenty of water. Water helps flush our systems of waste products and toxins, yet many of us go through life dehydrated—causing tiredness, low energy, and headaches."
"It’s common to mistake thirst for hunger, so staying well hydrated will also help you make healthier food choices."
"What is moderation? In essence, it means eating only as much food as your body needs."
"You should feel satisfied at the end of a meal, but not stuffed."
"For many of us, moderation means eating less than we do now. But it doesn’t mean eliminating the foods you love."
"Eating bacon for breakfast once a week, for example, could be considered moderation if you follow it with a healthy lunch and dinner—but not if you follow it with a box of donuts and a sausage pizza."
"Eating alone, especially in front of the TV or computer, often leads to mindless overeating."
"Control emotional eating. We don’t always eat just to satisfy hunger. Many of us also turn to food to relieve stress or cope with unpleasant emotions such as sadness, loneliness, or boredom."
"Fruit and vegetables are low in calories and nutrient dense, which means they are packed with vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and fiber."
Focus on eating the recommended daily amount of at least five servings of fruit and vegetables and it will naturally fill you up and help you cut back on unhealthy foods.
"Satisfy your sweet tooth. Naturally sweet vegetables—such as carrots, beets, sweet potatoes, yams, onions, bell peppers, and squash—add sweetness to your meals and reduce your cravings for added sugar."
"Cook green beans, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and asparagus in new ways. Instead of boiling or steaming these healthy sides, try grilling, roasting, or pan frying them with chili flakes, garlic, shallots, mushrooms, or onion. "
"While plain salads and steamed veggies can quickly become bland, there are plenty of ways to add taste to your vegetable dishes."
